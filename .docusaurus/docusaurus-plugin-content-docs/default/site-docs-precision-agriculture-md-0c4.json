  "description": "Remote sensing has as one of its objectives, to be able to provide useful information in the shortest possible time for decision-making. Therefore, it is considered a fundamental tool in precision agriculture, since it allows the monitoring of crops throughout the growing season, providing timely information as a diagnostic evaluation. This task must identify the factor that operates in a restrictive manner and decide, in a timely manner, on corrective agronomic intervention.",
